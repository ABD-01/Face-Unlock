# FaceNet

This is a pytorch implementation of [FaceNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832) paper with ResNet as the backbone architechture. At first the implementation was done on AT&T Dataset of Faces, then on LFW Dataset.

[Wandb](https://wandb.ai/) was used throughout this part of the project for metric tracking, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, etc. The wandb workspace can be viewed [here](https://wandb.ai/abd1/Face-Unlock).
